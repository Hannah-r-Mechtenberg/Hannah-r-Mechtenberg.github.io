# Hello, my name is Hannah Mechtenberg.

### I am currently a 2nd year PhD student, advised by Dr. Emily Myers and Dr. Eiling Yee, at the University of Connecticut. Before starting my PhD, I was a lab manager and research assistant with Dr. Myers for two years, and before that I worked with Dr. Carol Seger at Colorado State University.

Research-wise, I am interested in how speech perception and reward processing interact, and how we can use analogies to study semantic memory organization.
Outside of research, I devote time and energy to several scientific communication efforts. I am a freelance graphic designer, with special emphasis on collaborating with researchers on lab and grant logos. I also created a research digest, called the LAB Lab Digest, where I work with undergraduate research assistants to translate scientific articles for non-scientist audiences.
